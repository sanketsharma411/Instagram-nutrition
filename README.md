Flask-app for analyzing nutrient values for food related posts on Instagram

Setup:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```python runserver.py```, to start the Flask app
3. Navigate to ```localhost:5000/``` for the app

### Done :
1. Converting tags to nutrient values From the [WWW 15 poster] (https://github.com/sanketsharma411/Instagram-nutrition/blob/master/docs/www15.pdf). It can be accessed in the flask app at ```/nutrient/tags/<tags>```, returns a JSON object of the computed nutrient values.
2. 

### To Do:
3. Scraping IG data periodically to update topic models
4. Front-End

Eventually create an app which does the work described in the [CSCW'16 paper] (https://github.com/sanketsharma411/Instagram-nutrition/blob/master/docs/cscw16_food_deserts.pdf)
